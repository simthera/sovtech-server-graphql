# SovTech | Technical Assessment

This SovTech Technical Assessment for backend was done using ðŸ’™ Node and TypeScript.

## What tools did I use?

The React Essentials Boilerplate features a few of the most common and necessary libs to create a modern and expandable React App:

    A query language for your API

### [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

    Use Typescript to streamline, build, validate and better document your code.
